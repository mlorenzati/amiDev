# AmiDev
## Intruction
Amidev is just my attempt to build my amiga dev env with libs, where I will be adding more libraries and tests, more specifically to [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)

ItÂ´s based on the great work on [BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug](https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug) that defined a fully integrated amiga dev ide for vscode,
and [jyoberle fork with libs](https://github.com/jyoberle/vscode-amiga-debug) that integrated complete GCC with SDK libs support 

## How to build
Just install the vscode extension https://github.com/jyoberle/vscode-amiga-debug and open this project folder, then select the project to build and run, I just left A1200 options of each
executable.

Currently only the original MUI Test from jyoberle and the demo app from BartmanAbyss are compiling, linking and running in the WinUAE
